This financial support aims to bolster their entrepreneurial endeavours within the realm of traditional crafts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The total loan assistance available under this component amounts to Rs. 3,00,000\/-. Beneficiaries can access this assistance in two tranches:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1) First Loan Tranche: Eligible beneficiaries can avail of up to Rs. 1,00,000\/- as an initial capital injection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2) Second Loan Tranche: Upon successful utilization of the first tranche, beneficiaries can secure an additional loan of up to Rs. 2,00,000\/- to further expand their enterprises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This two-phased approach ensures a structured and sustainable flow of funds, enabling artisans and craftspeople to establish and grow their businesses while preserving the rich heritage of traditional craftsmanship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The disbursement of credit under the PM Vishwakarma Scheme is intricately linked to the attainment of specific training milestones. To become eligible for the first loan tranche, beneficiaries must successfully complete a 5-7 day Basic Training program provided by the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Subsequent to availing of the first tranche, beneficiaries can qualify for the second loan tranche by meeting certain criteria. They must have maintained a standard loan account for the first tranche, adopted digital transactions in their business operations, or undergone Advanced Training. Additionally, they are required to have repaid the entire first loan tranche before becoming eligible for the second tranche.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The repayment structure for these loans is designed to be convenient, with beneficiaries required to make monthly instalments. The specific repayment term varies and is outlined in Table 2.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This structured approach ensures that the beneficiaries receive financial support in tandem with skill development, fostering a conducive environment for the growth and sustainability of their enterprises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><th>Tranche<\/th><th>Amount of Loan<\/th><th>Term of Repayment<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1st Tranche<\/td><td>up to Rs. 1 Lakh<\/td><td>up to 18 months<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2nd Trance<\/td><td>up to Rs. 2 Lakh<\/td><td>up to 30 months<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading is-style-asterisk\">PM Vishwakarma Loan Concessional Interest and Interest Subvention<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Beneficiaries will pay a low-interest rate of only 5% on the loans they receive. The Government of India will provide substantial support by subsidizing an additional 8% of the interest upfront to the banks. This means the total interest charged by banks will be 13%, but beneficiaries only pay 5%. <a href=\"https:\/\/pmv.test\/pdf\/\">Annexure A<\/a> shows this calculation clearly.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>This subsidized 5% interest rate applies to both the first and second loan tranches that beneficiaries can receive.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Credit Oversight Committee led by the Secretary of the Department of Financial Services has the authority to revise the 8% government subsidy cap if needed, based on prevailing interest rates in the future.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In simple terms, the scheme offers loans at very low 5% interest rates to beneficiaries thanks to an 8% interest subsidy provided by the government upfront to banks. This subsidy can be adjusted by the oversight committee as per market conditions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading is-style-asterisk\">PM Vishwakarma Loan Guarantee<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To provide security and reduce risk for the lending institutions, all loans sanctioned under this scheme will be covered by a graded guarantee from the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE). This guarantee will be applied on a portfolio basis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Portfolio Creation<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The loan portfolio will be created annually, with each portfolio covering loans given out during the financial year.
