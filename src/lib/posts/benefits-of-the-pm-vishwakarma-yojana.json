This landmark initiative is a testament to the government&#8217;s commitment to empowering and uplifting this skilled workforce through a comprehensive array of benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we delve into the details of the PM Vishwakarma Yojana, meticulously exploring its various advantages to its beneficiaries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Beneficiaries of the PM Vishwakarma Yojana<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In its initial phase, the PM Vishwakarma Yojana aims to uplift the families of traditional artisans and craftspeople who have carried forward the age-old &#8216;Guru-Shishya&#8217; (master-disciple) tradition, encompassing 18 traditional trades. This ambitious scheme is designed to benefit an estimated 30 lakh individuals nationwide, thereby empowering a significant segment of the skilled workforce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it is important to note that individuals who have availed of similar schemes within the last five years are excluded from receiving the benefits offered under this initiative, ensuring a reasonable allocation of resources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Benefits of PM Vishwakarma Yojana<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The PM Vishwakarma scheme isn&#8217;t just about financial aid; it&#8217;s a comprehensive package designed to empower and uplift traditional artisans and craftspeople. Let&#8217;s delve into the array of benefits that await those who join this transformative program:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Recognition and Pride: The Vishwakarma Certificate and ID Card<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine the pride of holding a certificate that officially recognizes your mastery of a traditional craft.

These loans come with a low interest rate and the backing of the government, making them an accessible and reliable way to fuel your entrepreneurial aspirations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3.
